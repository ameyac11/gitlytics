A local-only GitHub traffic analytics tool with two modes:
- **🖥️ Web UI** — Beautiful Streamlit dashboard (recommended)
- **⌨️ CLI** — Terminal output + CSV export

View 14-day views, clones, referrers, and popular paths for **all** your repositories. Everything runs on your machine. Your token never leaves your device.

## 🚨 The 14-Day Catch (And How to Fix It!)

> **⚠️ Did you know?** GitHub normally **only saves your repository traffic data for 14 days**. After two weeks, your valuable views and clones data is permanently deleted.

**Don't lose your data!** We built a companion automation tool that runs silently in the background every 13 days using GitHub Actions to fetch and save your data permanently. 

👉 **[Set up GitHub Traffic Automation here](https://github.com/ameyac11/github-traffic-monitor-automation)** (It takes literally 2 minutes to set up!)

Once you have your automated data saved, you can seamlessly plug it right into this dashboard to visualize your beautiful, long-term historical charts.

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI.

```bash
# Basic CLI installation
pip install github-traffic-monitor

# Installation with Dashboard UI support
pip install "github-traffic-monitor[dashboard]"
```

### Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
To use either the CLI or Dashboard, you'll need a GitHub token.

1. Go to **[GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)**
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Select the **`repo`** scope — required to read traffic data for private repositories
4. Click **Generate token** and **copy it immediately**

> **🔒 Security Note:** Your token is completely safe, used only on your machine, and never sent to any external server. 

---

## 🖥️ Run: Streamlit Dashboard (Recommended)

If you installed with the `[dashboard]` extra, you can launch the beautiful web UI with a single command:

```bash
github-traffic-monitor dashboard
```

The app opens automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`. Paste your GitHub token into the sidebar and explore!

---

## ⌨️ Run: CLI (Terminal Mode)

If you just want terminal output or to export CSV files, you can use the CLI commands.

**Fetch data and print to terminal:**
```bash
github-traffic-monitor fetch --token ghp_your_token_here
```

**Fetch data and save to a specific CSV file:**
```bash
github-traffic-monitor fetch --token ghp_your_token_here --output my_report.csv
```

**Sync data (Append today's traffic to historical monthly CSVs):**
```bash
github-traffic-monitor sync --token ghp_your_token_here --dir ./data
```

You can also store your token in a `.env` file as `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...` so you don't have to type it out every time.
