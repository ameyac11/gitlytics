A local-only GitHub traffic analytics tool with two modes:
- **🖥️ Web UI** — Beautiful Streamlit dashboard (recommended)
- **⌨️ CLI** — Terminal output + CSV export

View 14-day views, clones, referrers, and popular paths for **all** your repositories. Everything runs on your machine. Your token never leaves your device.

## 🚨 The 14-Day Catch (And How to Fix It!)

> **⚠️ Did you know?** GitHub normally **only saves your repository traffic data for 14 days**. After two weeks, your valuable views and clones data is permanently deleted.

**Don't lose your data!** We built a companion automation tool that runs silently in the background every 13 days using GitHub Actions to fetch and save your data permanently. 

👉 **[Set up GitHub Traffic Automation here](https://github.com/ameyac11/Github_Traffic_Automation)** (It takes literally 2 minutes to set up!)

Once you have your automated data saved, you can seamlessly plug it right into this dashboard to visualize your beautiful, long-term historical charts.

## 🛠️ Setup (One-Time)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ameyac11/github-traffic-viewer.git
cd github-traffic-viewer
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to **[GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)**
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Give it a name (e.g. *Traffic Dashboard*)
4. Select the **`repo`** scope — required to read traffic data for private repositories
5. Click **Generate token** and **copy it immediately**

> **🔒 Security Note:**
> 
> **If running locally:** Your token is completely safe, used only on your machine, and never sent to any external server. It is kept only in memory during your active session.
> 
> **If using a deployed web version:** Please ensure you **delete/revoke your GitHub Personal Access Token** from GitHub immediately after fetching your report. While the app does not save your token anywhere (it is cleared immediately upon refreshing or closing the tab), deleting the token from GitHub is the safest practice.

---

## 🖥️ Run: Streamlit Dashboard (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app opens automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

1. Paste your GitHub token into the sidebar
2. Click **Connect to GitHub**
3. Click **Fetch Traffic Data**
4. Browse charts, explore per-repo details, and download the CSV

---

## ⌨️ Run: CLI (Terminal Mode)

The CLI reads your token from a `.env` file or an environment variable.

**Option A — `.env` file (recommended):**

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# Open .env and add your token
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

Then run:
```bash
python github_traffic_fetch.py
```

**Option B — pass token directly:**
```bash
python github_traffic_fetch.py --token ghp_your_token_here
```

**Option C — custom output filename:**
```bash
python github_traffic_fetch.py --output my_report.csv
```

**View all options:**
```bash
python github_traffic_fetch.py --help
```
