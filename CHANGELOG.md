# Changelog

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-20
### Added
- Added `-m` / `--metrics` filtering parameters to CLI commands (`fetch`, `sync`) and Python API functions to selectively fetch or sync specific metrics.
- Implemented concurrent threading in the backend for faster deep API fetching of commits, pull requests, releases, and community profiles.
- Added a backend endpoint to query public user profiles and repositories.
- Added PNG, PDF, and Developer Card export features to download high-resolution dashboard snapshots, multi-page PDF reports, and shareable summary cards.
- Integrated a global export state hook and CSS overrides to disable transitions and Recharts animations during exports, preventing incomplete or transparent visual elements.
- Applied Apache-2.0 License with Commons Clause v1.0.

### Changed
- Improved the frontend dashboard UI/UX styling, metrics card layouts, and avatar ring aesthetics.
- Optimized and corrected traffic date normalization logic in `process.py`.
## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-18
### Changed
- Updated the primary project logo to a newer, higher-resolution version across the dashboard and README.

### Fixed
- Addressed minor bugs and visual inconsistencies in the dashboard interface to improve overall user experience.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-17
### Added
- Added official documentation portal links (`docs.gitlytics.dev`) to PyPI metadata and README.

### Changed
- Renamed the internal `frontend` directory to `dashboard` to match Vercel deployments.
- Updated PyPI metadata with the official project domain (`gitlytics.dev`) and author contact info.
- Improved GitHub Actions workflow to use `npm ci` for deterministic UI builds on Node 24.
- Refactored internal API error messaging to accurately reflect the new dashboard directory structure.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Bumped version to 0.1.3 to resolve PyPI upload conflict (version 0.1.2 was already taken).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- Traffic data now always returns exactly 14 days, even when GitHub omits dates with zero views.
- Background sync cron process no longer hangs silently — exits cleanly on expired tokens (401).
- Database no longer fragments when the sync cron job runs from a different working directory.
- Cron logs now appear correctly in all environments instead of being swallowed by stdout buffering.
- Star and fork counts now reflect the latest snapshot rather than an inflated cumulative sum.
- Fixed `export_json_database` doubling traffic counts when reading overlapping monthly and yearly CSV files.
- Fixed JSON timeseries payload missing `clones` due to a duplicate `unique_visitors` dictionary key.
- Fixed CLI package entry point (added `__main__.py`) allowing execution via `python -m gitlytics`.

### Changed
- JSON exports now strip private repositories by default (`export_public_only=True`) to prevent accidental leaks.
- Dashboard now preloads historical CSVs on boot instead of relying solely on live GitHub API data.
- React frontend now reads the API URL from `VITE_API_URL`, allowing independent deployment (e.g. Vercel).

### Added
- Added `docs/api_documentation.md` with code examples and parameter tables for `fetch_traffic`, `sync`, and `serve_dashboard`.
- `croniter` dependency for cron scheduling support.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-15

- Replaced Streamlit backend with FastAPI + Uvicorn.
