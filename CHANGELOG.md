# Changelog

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Bumped version to 0.1.3 to resolve PyPI upload conflict (version 0.1.2 was already taken).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-16
### Fixed
- Traffic data now always returns exactly 14 days, even when GitHub omits dates with zero views.
- Background sync cron process no longer hangs silently — exits cleanly on expired tokens (401).
- Database no longer fragments when the sync cron job runs from a different working directory.
- Cron logs now appear correctly in all environments instead of being swallowed by stdout buffering.
- Star and fork counts now reflect the latest snapshot rather than an inflated cumulative sum.
- Fixed `export_json_database` doubling traffic counts when reading overlapping monthly and yearly CSV files.
- Fixed JSON timeseries payload missing `clones` due to a duplicate `unique_visitors` dictionary key.
- Fixed CLI package entry point (added `__main__.py`) allowing execution via `python -m gitlytics`.

### Changed
- JSON exports now strip private repositories by default (`export_public_only=True`) to prevent accidental leaks.
- Dashboard now preloads historical CSVs on boot instead of relying solely on live GitHub API data.
- React frontend now reads the API URL from `VITE_API_URL`, allowing independent deployment (e.g. Vercel).

### Added
- Added `docs/api_documentation.md` with code examples and parameter tables for `fetch_traffic`, `sync`, and `serve_dashboard`.
- `croniter` dependency for cron scheduling support.
